##### Project Scope
Developing a mobile app that will link connect food vendors and customers for late-night deals



## Motivation 

Food wastage is one of Singaporeâ€™s largest problems. In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste, which is equivalent to 51,000 double decker buses. 

A large proportion of food waste is caused by businesses selling perishables such as bread and cakes. Since these perishables cannot be kept overnight to sell the following day, these businesses - especially bakeries - usually have sales and big discounts in the final hours of operation for the day to try to get rid of their leftovers. Otherwise, these perishables have to be disposed of at the end of the day, thus contributing to food wastage. 

As such, we have come up with a solution to help business owners sell their food items at the end of the day in a more effective and efficient way.


## Aim 

We hope to reduce food waste in Singapore, while helping food vendors clear their perishables. Through our mobile application, we hope to connect individuals who are looking for discounted F&B items with nearby businesses who are offering discounts.


## User Stories

As a food stall vendor, I want to finish selling my food (at a discounted price) to reduce my losses.

As a hungry customer, I want to be able to look for the best quality and cheapest deals near me to satisfy my hunger. 


## Project Idea

We aim to build a mobile app which has the following features:

- Food vendors can showcase their discounted food items 
- Users can search for nearby stalls which offer discounted food items
- Users will be directed to their chosen stall 
- Users will be able to leave a review for the food/business


## Testing

We will test the app among some bakeries in the Clementi/NUS area.
